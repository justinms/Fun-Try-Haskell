# Fun-Try-Haskell
Try to build a tiny thing all by our hands, and wish it to be fun.


* Now let us begin.
* Since it just a start, I think we should do it gradually.
* My first motivation is to write a project so that it can calculate some Quantum physics problems, 
though it may seem to be really hard at first glance.
* Anyway, we just to write something interesting, and it happened to be correct and useful for our own sake,
then it is just fine.
* Write it in another language may give us a new view of our problem; Learn it by just do it.
* *Sentences above gone be change soon!!!*
