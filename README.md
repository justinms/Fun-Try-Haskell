# Fun-Try-Haskell


## Why
Believe it or not, it's always a fun to build things all by one's hands, bit by bit, little by little, block by block, and perhaps in someday, another Rome is built inadvertently. This is our motivation to start this projects here, where we can try some codes, share some ideas, and do some exercises. Of course, we use Haskell here, which is a purely functional language with strong typing and laziness...Ok, no matter what it was, we just fall in love with it at first or second or third sight, ^_^, and we believe we will get a different view while it keep us company. So now just let us start here to build our Rome with such a fancy tool. 

## What to do
Since we just start this project in the heat of the moment, we havn't done any real things. Nevertheless, we have some fancy ideas at this very beginning.

* We want do some short exercises, if lucky enough these exercises maybe finally get into our real project.

* We teach and learn form each other by doing things together.

* We will write a better documentation for our projects, and some codes from https://hackage.haskell.org/ if it is adapaed for our own usage.

* We will learn things, this maybe fancy thoughts, interesting knowledge, funny stories, which is behind or even beyond the codes.
 
* TODO write a Plan 

* TODO write a better Readme.md soon.

* ...

Life is so short, and we just naively want to make a little contribution. If not, just have fun.
